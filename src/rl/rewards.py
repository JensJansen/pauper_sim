"""Reward functions for training a DRL policy against the game engine.

Contract: any callable

    reward_fn(state: game.GameState, done: bool, horizon: int) -> float

Called once per environment step with the state *after* that step's
action was applied. A sparse reward function returns 0.0 unless `done`;
a dense one could return something every call. No base class -- any
matching callable works.

Only WIN/LOSS rewards live here: a loss, draw, or horizon cutoff is always
0.0; a win's own value is scaled by how efficiently it was reached. The old
single-player Tron-era heuristics (resource-quality tie-breakers) and the
turn-decay fast_win_reward went away with the 1-player pipeline -- league
self-play uses action_count_win_reward_200_floor02.

    """Win/loss reward whose "prefer efficiency" axis is the WINNING seat's
    own action count (PlayerState.actions_taken -- real, non-Pass actions
    only, per-seat, never combined across both seats, and never counting an
    automatic draw-for-turn as an "action" -- see actions_taken's own
    docstring) rather than a global turn count: turn-based decay lets a policy
    take arbitrarily many actions within a single turn "for free" (nothing
    below turn granularity was ever measured), so it can't actually discourage
    padding out a turn with pointless actions the way a per-action metric can.

    Piecewise linear, not a pure decay -- a plain decay**actions_taken starts
    penalizing from action 1, and even clamped to a floor came out too close
    to a loss's flat 0 to read as "still clearly a win," while rewarding
    nothing for finishing within a perfectly reasonable number of actions.
    This version has three flat request-driven reference points instead: an
    actions_taken <= plateau_actions (80, "sufficiently fast" -- no reason to
    reward going even faster) -> max_reward (1.0); actions_taken >= max_actions
    (200) -> min_reward (0.25, clearly above a loss's 0); linear ramp between
    the two. A loss or draw is still exactly 0.0 either way -- only a win's own
    value moves."""
